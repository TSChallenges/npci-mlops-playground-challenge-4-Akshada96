## NPCI MLOps Playground Challenge-4  (20 Marks)

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan based on factors such as credit history, repayment capacity, and annual income. This model aims to assist financial institutions in assessing the potential financial impact of credit risk and making informed lending decisions.

### Steps to Follow
1. This GitHub repository will be accessible to you once you accept the Playground Challenge.
2. You have to work directly in this GitHub repository. It is like your own copy of the original repository.

3. The folder structure is as given below:
   ```
   root
   ├── ML_Classification_Model_Building.ipynb    # Python notebook
   ├── credit_risk_dataset.csv                   # dataset file
   └── requirements.txt                          # file containing a list of required packages
   ```

4. Review the code/comments present in above notebook to understand the problem statement.
5. Implement the exercises marked with **TODO** comments.
6. To work on the notebook:
    - Start a new GitHub Codespace.
    - Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - Write your code in the notebook's code cell and execute it. 
    - On the first run, it will prompt you to install the `Python` and `Jupyter` extentions. Go ahead and install them.
    - Next, it will ask you to select a `Python Environment` - choose the one marked as 'Recommended'.
    - After that, the code cell should execute without any issues.
7. Once done, push your changes to this remote GitHub repository.

### Files to Work On
- `ML_Classification_Model_Building.ipynb`

### Requirements:
1. Implement the exercises given in the notebook.
2. Write clean and understandable code.

## Submission Requirements:
After completing the challenge and developing the solution code in GitHub codespace, present it to the faculty for grading. 

Later, commit and push the changes to this repository either via the terminal or the Source Control icon showing on the left sidebar.

If using terminal:
  - Stage your changes and commit the files:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Completed playground challenge"
    ```
  - Push your changes to the GitHub repository:
    ```
    git push
    ```

If using the Source Control icon:
  - Go to the Source Control icon.
  - Click on `+` icon (showing on the `Changes` dropdown) to stage all your changes.
  - Enter a commit message and select `Commit`.
  - At last, select `Sync Changes` to push your changes to the GitHub repository

Good luck, and happy coding!
