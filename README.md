## NPCI MLOps Playground Challenge-4

### Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan based on factors such as credit history, repayment capacity, and annual income. This model aims to assist financial institutions in assessing the potential financial impact of credit risk and making informed lending decisions.

### Steps to Follow
1. This GitHub repository will be accessible to you once you accept the Playground Challenge.
2. You have to work directly in this GitHub repository. It is like your own copy of the original repository.

3. The folder structure is as given below:
   ```
   root
   ├── ML_Classification_Model_Building.ipynb    # Python notebook
   ├── credit_risk_dataset.csv                   # dataset file
   └── requirements.txt                          # file containing list of required packages
   ```

4. Review the code/comments present in above notebook to understand the problem statement.
5. Implement the exercies marked with **TODO** comments.
6. To work on the notebook, you can clone this GitHub repository onto your system and then open it with an IDE like VS Code, or Google Colab.
7. Once done, push your changes to this remote GitHub repository.

### Files to Work On
- `ML_Classification_Model_Building.ipynb`

### Requirements:
1. Implement the exercies given in the notebook.
2. Write clean and understandable code.

## Submission Requirements:
After completing the challenge and developing the solution code in your system, present it to the faculty for grading. 

Later, commit and push the changes to this repository. 
  - Stage your changes and commit the files:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Completed playground challenge"
    ```
  - Push your changes to the GitHub repository:
    ```
    git push
    ```

Good luck, and happy coding!
