When financial institutions extend services like mortgages, credit cards, or personal loans, there exists an inherent risk that the borrower may default on their repayment obligations. To evaluate this risk, factors like credit history, repayment capacity, loan terms, and annual income can be considered.\n","\n","Many companies, especially financial institutions, evaluate the credit risk of their existing and forthcoming customers. With the advent of technologies like machine learning, organizations can analyze customer data to establish a risk profile. Credit risk modeling evaluates a borrower's credit risk based primarily on two factors. The first factor is determining the probability of a borrower defaulting on a loan, while the second factor involves evaluating the financial impact on the lender in case of such a default.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"BydFYr4d-ZZY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Dataset Description\n","\n","The dataset you'll be working with is the Credit Risk dataset, which includes the following features:\n","\n","* **person_age** - Age\n","* **person_income** - Annual Income\n","* **person_home_ownership** - Home ownership\n","* **person_emp_length** - Employment length (in years)\n","* **loan_intent** - Loan intent\n","* **loan_grade** - Loan grade\n","* **loan_amnt** - Loan amount\n","* **loan_int_rate** - Interest rate\n","* **loan_status** - Loan status (0 is non default 1 is default)\n","* **loan_percent_income** - Percent income\n","* **cb_person_default_on_file** - Historical default\n","* **cb_preson_cred_hist_length** - Credit history length\n"],"metadata":{"id":"G09nMTuT0C5O"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Importing required packages\n"],"metadata":{"id":"AUs6CBWi0um5"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"0Ua1j5P97nDi"},"outputs":[],"source":["#ToDo"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Loading the data"],"metadata":{"id":"yIYAZEeF7aQo"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# First upload the provided `credit_risk_dataset.csv` then load it as pandas dataframe\n","#ToDo"],"metadata":{"id":"5g-3iZWf79ei"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### EDA\n","Explore the data, understand the features and handle the missing values."],"metadata":{"id":"hUJOesoM-ZYg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Get the shape of the dataframe\n","#ToDo"],"metadata":{"id":"s9cYFWwN7ZYu"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Display few rows of the dataframe\n","#ToDo"],"metadata":{"id":"5BEmlWRL8Vad"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Generate descriptive statistics for the DataFrame.To get summary statistics for numerical columns.\n","#ToDo"],"metadata":{"id":"2vA5UhTG8YEa"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Generate information about the DataFrame, including index details, column data types, non-null values, and memory usage.\n","#ToDo"],"metadata":{"id":"3VApgDn28h0u"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### DATA Preprocessing"],"metadata":{"id":"h2K7-WqNCzT3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Handling Missing values"],"metadata":{"id":"8k8WmqIBBEui"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Display the total number of null values of each column\n","#ToDo"],"metadata":{"id":"9yindfUN8i50"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Columns **person_emp_length** and **loan_int_rate** have null values.\n","Handle them by replacing the missing values with the mean of the respective columns.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hE4Cf73ABedq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Handle missing values - replace the missing values with the mean\n","#ToDo"],"metadata":{"id":"0U4rQoKo8l9L"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Handling categorical columns"],"metadata":{"id":"TcY-K5XwC6Hn"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Check for categorical columns\n","#ToDo"],"metadata":{"id":"BByZ-fJg_AHt"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Get the distinct categories present in each categorical column\n","#ToDo"],"metadata":{"id":"O6YVzrJuAGRX"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create dictionaries to map categorical values to numbers.
